# League Disenchanter

A basic AutoHotkey script to disenchant Champion shards in League of Legends.

Hotkeys:<br/>
Windows Key+F2: Start the Script<br/>
Windows Key+F3: Toggle: Stop/Resume Script<br/>
Windows Key+F4: Quit Script<br/>
Script by https://github.com/StealthOrc

Requirements:<br/>
Desktop Resolution of 1080p (e.g. 1920x1080, 2560x1080)

League Client Window Size: 1600x900<br/>
Make sure your League Client Window Size is set to 1600 x 900.<br/>
Open your League Client, open Settings, under General scroll down 'Window Size'

4k Resolutions don't work as I don't own any, so sadly you're out of luck. :c
